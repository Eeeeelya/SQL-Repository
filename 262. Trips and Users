Write a solution to find the cancellation rate of requests with unbanned users (both client and driver must not be banned) each day between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03".
Round Cancellation Rate to two decimal points.

WITH cte AS
(SELECT * FROM trips
WHERE client_id NOT IN (SELECT users_id FROM users WHERE banned = 'Yes')
AND driver_id NOT IN (SELECT users_id FROM users WHERE banned = 'Yes'))

SELECT request_at AS "Day",
ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN status LIKE 'cancelled%' THEN 1.00 ELSE 0 END),2) AS "Cancellation Rate"
FROM cte WHERE request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03'
GROUP BY request_at ORDER BY request_at;
