Question:
Write a query to compare the average salary of employees in each department to the company's average salary for March 2024.
Return the comparison result as 'higher', 'lower', or 'same' for each department. Display the department ID, payment month (in MM-YYYY format), and the comparison result.

Query:
WITH compavg AS(SELECT payment_date, AVG(amount)
FROM salary 
WHERE EXTRACT(month FROM payment_date) = '03'
AND EXTRACT(year FROM payment_date) = '2024'
GROUP BY payment_date),

deptavg AS(SELECT e.department_id, TO_CHAR(s.payment_date, 'MM-YYYY') datemarch, AVG(s.amount)
FROM employee e
JOIN salary s ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id
WHERE EXTRACT(month FROM payment_date) = '03'
AND EXTRACT(year FROM payment_date) = '2024'
GROUP BY e.department_id, datemarch)

SELECT deptavg.department_id, deptavg.datemarch payment_date,
CASE WHEN compavg.avg > deptavg.avg THEN 'lower'
WHEN compavg.avg < deptavg.avg THEN 'higher'
ELSE 'same' END AS comparison FROM deptavg,compavg
